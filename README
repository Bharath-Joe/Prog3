Special Instructions:

To run this program:

python3 memSim.py <filename> <FRAMES> <PRA>
-------------------------------------------
Frames can be any integer > 0 and <= 256.
PRA can be any of the following: FIFO, LRU, OPT.

For this project we implemented our own way of dealing with tie-breakers when it 
comes to the PRAs. Therefore, the frame number printed out might not be the same, 
but the hit and fault rate shouldn't be affected.
